This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR). The issue is that Tailwind's purge feature removes unused CSS classes during the build process. However, if some classes are only used within components that are not rendered on the server (e.g., components rendered only after user interaction), the purge process might remove those classes, causing them to be missing at runtime. This results in the classes not being applied, and the related styles not being rendered in the UI, leading to unexpected visual inconsistencies.
